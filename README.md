# InsightBot

## Project Overview

InsightBot is an AI-powered conversational data analysis assistant designed to make data exploration and insight generation accessible to everyone. By combining natural language processing with secure code execution and rich visualizations, InsightBot enables users to interact with their data intuitively—simply by chatting. The platform is ideal for users who want to analyze, visualize, and understand their datasets without writing code, making advanced analytics approachable for all skill levels.

InsightBot bridges the gap between technical data science and everyday business or research needs. It empowers users to:
- Uncover hidden patterns and trends in their data
- Generate professional-quality visualizations on demand
- Receive actionable insights in plain English
- Document and share findings effortlessly

## Features

- **Conversational Data Analysis**: Engage in natural language conversations to explore and analyze your data. Ask questions, request summaries, or seek specific insights, and receive clear, context-aware responses.
- **CSV File Upload**: Easily upload CSV files to begin your analysis. The chatbot automatically recognizes and processes your dataset, providing instant access to its structure and contents.
- **AI-Generated Insights**: Leverage advanced AI models to uncover patterns, trends, anomalies, and correlations in your data. InsightBot provides both statistical summaries and narrative explanations.
- **Data Visualizations**: Request a wide range of visualizations (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, etc.) generated on demand. Visual outputs are seamlessly integrated into the chat for immediate review.
- **PDF Export**: Export your entire chat session, including insights, code, and visualizations, as a professionally formatted PDF report for sharing or record-keeping.
- **Secure Code Execution**: All code generated by the AI is executed in a sandboxed environment with strict import and operation restrictions, ensuring user safety and data privacy.
- **First Look Dashboard**: Instantly receive an automated overview of your dataset, including key statistics and suggested questions to kickstart your analysis.
- **Session Management**: Manage uploaded files, clear sessions, and maintain a history of your conversations for reference and reproducibility.
- **Automated Anomaly & Trend Detection**: The system can automatically highlight outliers, trends, and correlations in your data, helping you spot important patterns without manual effort.
- **Suggested Questions**: Based on your dataset, InsightBot proposes relevant questions to help guide your analysis and spark new ideas.
- **Inline Code and Results**: All code and results are presented inline, making it easy to follow the logic and see how insights are derived.

## Usage Guide (Chatbot Only)

1. **Upload Your Data**: Start by uploading a CSV file through the sidebar. The chatbot will automatically process your file and display a summary of its contents.
2. **Start the Conversation**: Type your questions or analysis requests in natural language. For example, "Show me the distribution of sales by region" or "Are there any missing values?"
3. **Receive Insights and Visualizations**: The chatbot responds with narrative insights, code snippets (when helpful), and inline visualizations directly in the chat interface.
4. **Export Results**: At any point, export your chat session and insights as a PDF report for easy sharing or documentation.
5. **Iterate and Explore**: Continue the conversation to dig deeper, refine your questions, or explore new aspects of your data. The chatbot maintains context, allowing for a seamless analytical flow.

**Tips for Effective Use:**
- Ask open-ended questions to explore your data broadly, or specific questions for targeted analysis.
- Request visualizations to better understand distributions, relationships, or trends.
- Use follow-up questions to clarify or expand on previous insights.

## Code Executor

InsightBot features a custom Secure Code Executor that safely runs Python code generated by the AI. Key aspects include:

- **Sandboxed Environment**: Only a limited set of safe libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) are allowed. Dangerous operations and imports are strictly blocked.
- **Validation and Monitoring**: All code is validated for security risks before execution. The executor monitors for unsafe patterns and prevents unauthorized access to the system or files.
- **Result Integration**: Outputs from code execution, including plots and tables, are captured and displayed inline within the chat, providing a seamless analytical experience.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: The executor ensures that each code execution is isolated, preventing interference between different analyses and maintaining a clean environment.
- **Error Handling**: If code execution fails, the chatbot provides clear error messages and suggestions for correction, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Logic Explanation

- **User Query Processing**: When a user submits a message, InsightBot combines the query with dataset context and sends it to the AI model.
- **AI Response Generation**: The AI generates a natural language response, often including Python code for analysis or visualization.
- **Secure Execution**: Any code in the response is extracted and executed in the sandboxed environment. Results (text or images) are parsed and inserted back into the chat.
- **Conversation History**: All interactions are stored, allowing users to review previous questions, answers, and generated insights.
- **PDF Export**: The entire chat, including code and visualizations, can be exported as a comprehensive PDF report.
- **Automated Insights**: On file upload, the system automatically analyzes the dataset and provides a "First Look Dashboard" with key statistics and suggested next steps.
- **Session State Management**: The application maintains session state for uploaded files, chat history, and code execution context, ensuring continuity and reproducibility.
