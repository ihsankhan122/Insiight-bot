## 💡 Usage Guide (Chatbot Only)

1. **Upload Your Data**: Start by uploading a CSV file through the sidebar. The chatbot will automatically process your file and display a summary of its contents.
2. **Start the Conversation**: Type your questions or analysis requests in natural language. For example, _"Show me the distribution of sales by region"_ or _"Are there any missing values?"_
3. **Receive Insights and Visualizations**: The chatbot responds with narrative insights, code snippets (when helpful), and inline visualizations directly in the chat interface.
4. **Export Results**: At any point, export your chat session and insights as a PDF report for easy sharing or documentation.
5. **Iterate and Explore**: Continue the conversation to dig deeper, refine your questions, or explore new aspects of your data. The chatbot maintains context, allowing for a seamless analytical flow.

> **Tips for Effective Use:**
> - Ask open-ended questions to explore your data broadly, or specific questions for targeted analysis.
> - Request visualizations to better understand distributions, relationships, or trends.
> - Use follow-up questions to clarify or expand on previous insights.

## 🛡️ Code Executor

InsightBot features a custom **Secure Code Executor** that safely runs Python code generated by the AI. Key aspects include:

- 🏝️ **Sandboxed Environment**: Only a limited set of safe libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) are allowed. Dangerous operations and imports are strictly blocked.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Validation and Monitoring**: All code is validated for security risks before execution. The executor monitors for unsafe patterns and prevents unauthorized access to the system or files.
- 🔗 **Result Integration**: Outputs from code execution, including plots and tables, are captured and displayed inline within the chat, providing a seamless analytical experience.
- 🧹 **Automatic Cleanup**: The executor ensures that each code execution is isolated, preventing interference between different analyses and maintaining a clean environment.
- 🚨 **Error Handling**: If code execution fails, the chatbot provides clear error messages and suggestions for correction, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## 🧠 Logic Explanation

- 🗣️ **User Query Processing**: When a user submits a message, InsightBot combines the query with dataset context and sends it to the AI model.
- 🤖 **AI Response Generation**: The AI generates a natural language response, often including Python code for analysis or visualization.
- 🛡️ **Secure Execution**: Any code in the response is extracted and executed in the sandboxed environment. Results (text or images) are parsed and inserted back into the chat.
- 📝 **Conversation History**: All interactions are stored, allowing users to review previous questions, answers, and generated insights.
- 📄 **PDF Export**: The entire chat, including code and visualizations, can be exported as a comprehensive PDF report.
- 📊 **Automated Insights**: On file upload, the system automatically analyzes the dataset and provides a "First Look Dashboard" with key statistics and suggested next steps.
- 🔄 **Session State Management**: The application maintains session state for uploaded files, chat history, and code execution context, ensuring continuity and reproducibility.
